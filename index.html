    <!-- Review the mockup.jpg and see if you can sketch the rows and columns on a 12column grid to create this Piet Mondrian inspired picture 
          You will need to create some html add Bootstap Grid classes for the structure of the picture and you will need to create some custom css for the colors and borders
          Try to see if you can use pseudo-selectors to re-create the image
          Bootstrap Grid reference can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

          <!-- "to start you off I have added the required bootstrap "container" class for a grid. "mondrian" is just the name of the frame -->
          <!-- add additional divs with bootstrap classes as "rows" or "columns" based on your wireframe sketch of the mockup -->
